# adsb

My ADS-B setup based on the fabulous work of [sdr-enthusiasts](https://github.com/sdr-enthusiasts).

This setup uses [docker-adsb-ultrafeeder](https://github.com/sdr-enthusiasts/docker-adsb-ultrafeeder) as the core ADS-B receiver and feeder, which consolidates readsb, tar1090, graphs1090, and autogain into a single container.
